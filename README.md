# About-Me

Hi there 👋🏽 

I'm a Data Analyst with experience using Agile methodologies. I am proficient in creating complex queries in SQL, troubleshooting and debugging existing queries for performance tuning and faster run time. I have experience with both PostgreSQL and MySQL to extract, manipulate, and analyze data from various relational databases, and have also worked with non-relational databases including data warehouses such as AWS Redshift, Google Big Query and Azure Databricks. 

I have a proven record of presenting meaningful business insights from large datasets using dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. I am also well-versed in Python and continuously use it to write scripts for data cleaning, data transformation and for automating workflows and data wrangling tasks. For smaller size datasets, I turn to MS Excel or Google Sheets to conduct advanced or less complex exploratory and explanatory data analysis.

I am a fast learner and a self-starter who can work independently as well as part of a team. I manage multiple projects and meet deadlines, while also paying attention to detail. I enjoy creating detailed reports containing insights, visualizations and recommendations that help companies make data-driven decisions.
